# BlackJack Project

# Our Blackjack House Rules
# 1. The deck is unlimited in size. 
# 2. There are no jokers. The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10. The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
# 3. Use the following list as the deck of cards: cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]  
# 4. The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
# 5. Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
# 6. The computer is the dealer.
