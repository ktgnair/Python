# Reeborg's World

# Lost in a maze
# Reeborg was exploring a dark maze and the battery in its flashlight ran out.
# Write a program using an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit. 
# The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze, 
# turning right if it can, going straight ahead if it canâ€™t turn right, or turning left as a last resort.
